## Challenge Goals

This challenge illustrates the importance of a responsive layout.

## CSS Organization

The CSS mirrors the visual format of the page, from top to bottom, starting with the header and ending with the footer. The comments specify each section of the webpage, which helps eleminate redundancies.
